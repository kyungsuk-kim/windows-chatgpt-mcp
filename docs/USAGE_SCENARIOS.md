## Code Development and Review

### Scenario 3: Multi-AI Code Review

**Situation:** Getting comprehensive code review from multiple AI perspectives.

**Example:**
```python
# Your Python function
def process_user_data(users):
    results = []
    for user in users:
        if user['age'] > 18:
            processed = {
                'name': user['name'].upper(),
                'email': user['email'].lower(),
                'status': 'active'
            }
            results.append(processed)
    return results
```

**Conversation:**
```
You: Here's a Python function I wrote. Can you review it for potential issues?

Claude: I'll review your function and also get ChatGPT's perspective for a comprehensive analysis.

My initial observations:
- Function lacks error handling for missing keys
- No input validation
- Could be more efficient with list comprehension

Let me get ChatGPT's review as well.

[Uses send_message tool with the code]

ChatGPT Response: [Detailed code review with suggestions for error handling, type hints, documentation, and performance improvements]

Claude: Combining both reviews, here's a comprehensive improvement plan:

1. **Error Handling** (Both AIs agree): Add try-catch for KeyError
2. **Input Validation** (My suggestion): Validate input parameter
3. **Type Hints** (ChatGPT's suggestion): Add type annotations
4. **Performance** (ChatGPT's suggestion): Use list comprehension
5. **Documentation** (Both AIs agree): Add docstring

Here's the improved version:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any

def process_user_data(users: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Process user data by filtering adults and formatting their information.
    
    Args:
        users: List of user dictionaries with 'age', 'name', and 'email' keys
        
    Returns:
        List of processed user dictionaries
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If users is not a list or contains invalid data
    """
    if not isinstance(users, list):
        raise ValueError("Users must be a list")
    
    results = []
    for user in users:
        try:
            if user.get('age', 0) > 18:
                processed = {
                    'name': str(user['name']).upper(),
                    'email': str(user['email']).lower(),
                    'status': 'active'
                }
                results.append(processed)
        except (KeyError, TypeError) as e:
            print(f"Skipping invalid user data: {e}")
            continue
    
    return results
```
```
